## What you will find in this repository

I started writing little **Javascript** recipes in the summer of 2019 as a way to summarize concepts and tricks and share them with the entire community. Since then, every Wednesday I publish a new one in my social networks:

🐦 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/latteandcode)

Since then many of you have asked me to put all of them together somewhere and finally here it is.

I have grouped the recipes into 9 chapters:

1. [Objects & Arrays](https://github.com/ger86/recetas-javascripteras/tree/master/1.%20Objects%20%26%20Arrays)
2. [Functions](https://github.com/ger86/recetas-javascripteras/tree/master/2.%20Functions)
3. [Classes](https://github.com/ger86/recetas-javascripteras/tree/master/3.%20Classes)
4. [Special Objects (like Date or Intl)](https://github.com/ger86/recetas-javascripteras/tree/master/4.%20Special%20Objects)
5. [Asynchronous](https://github.com/ger86/recetas-javascripteras/tree/master/5.%20Asynchronous)
6. [Good to know](https://github.com/ger86/recetas-javascripteras/tree/master/6.%20Good%20to%20know)
7. [ECMAScript](https://github.com/ger86/recetas-javascripteras/tree/master/7.%20ECMAScript)
8. [Web Development](https://github.com/ger86/recetas-javascripteras/tree/master/8.%20Web%20Development)
9. [Programming Concepts](https://github.com/ger86/recetas-javascripteras/tree/master/9.%20Programming%20Concepts)

In addition, I have taken the opportunity to rewrite each of them in "markdown" format, which has allowed me to complement them with links and videos. In short, "java script recipes" have gone up one more level!

Of course, all the new ones that you create will appear in this repository so you can leave it as a favorite if you want to receive the latest updates.

And as it is tradition, I hope you like these recipes and help you to continue learning!
